**Tag Push** could add a tag string to your latest commit message and then push.

> What for? E.g., you could add a "build" tag to trigger the CI/CD Pipeline when you want.

## Features

- Add a tag string to your latest commit message and then push.
- Create an empty commit with the tag string when there are no new commits locally, which is disabled by default.
- The tag string is configurable.
- Pull automatically if necessary.
- You can choose whether to commit the changes staged.
- You can choose whether to publish the branch that does not exist, or was deleted in the remote repository.

1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / âŒ˜+Shift+P) and type `Tag Push`.
2. Click "Tag Push" in the status bar.
